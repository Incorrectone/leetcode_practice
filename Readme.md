# Practice Code for leetcode

Will update with code for leetcode solutions as I do them in batches. Code will be as I wrote and submitted in leetcode, with just an extra header file. With test cases for each.

## Running the Makefile

1. Ensure you have build-essential installed
2. Run the command, copy the folder name for which every tests you want to run.
```bash
    ~$ make run P=<folder_name>
    ~$ make run P=238_Product_of_Array_Except_Self 
```

## About

These are in no way guaranteed to be the correct solutions. They may add new testcases which may make the code logically incorrect.
